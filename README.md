# AC Repo

Welcome to my Competitive Programming Solutions Repository. Here you will find a collection of solutions to various competitive programming sites such as CodeForces, HackerRank, LeetCode, and more. In the future, I plan to also include boilerplate scripts that tend to repeat, such as Binary Search, DP, Dijkstra, Sorting, Segment Tree, etc.
